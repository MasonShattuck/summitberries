<h1>About Summit Berries LLC</h1>
<p>
  At Summit Berries LLC, our name is more than a brand — it’s a vision inspired by the poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning:
</p>
<blockquote>
  “Every bush is aflame with the fire of God, but only those who see take off their shoes. The rest just pick the berries.”
</blockquote>
<p>
  For us, “Berries” symbolize the small details of everyday life, while “Summit” represents rising above the ordinary.
  Together, Summit Berries means bringing mindfulness, excellence, and care into property management.
</p>
<p>
  We don’t just maintain homes — we elevate them. Every detail matters, every client deserves care, and every property should reflect the beauty and potential within it.
</p>
