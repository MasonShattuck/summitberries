      <p class="sb-body-lg sb-sub">
        At Summit Berries LLC, our name is more than a brand — it’s a vision inspired by Elizabeth Barrett Browning:
        <em>“Every bush is aflame with the fire of God, but only those who see take off their shoes. The rest just pick the berries.”</em>
      </p>
      <p class="sb-body-lg">
        “Berries” symbolize the small details of everyday life, while “Summit” represents rising above the ordinary.
        Together, Summit Berries means bringing mindfulness, excellence, and care into property management.
